                                        Introduction Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, is not just about abstaining
                                        from food and drink; it is also a time of
                                        reflection, charity, and helping those in need. At the University of Ghana (UG),
                                        Ramadan is a time when students come
                                        together to break their fast with family, friends, and fellow students. However,
                                        for some, the cost of purchasing iftar
                                        meals can be a financial challenge. This is where the spirit of contribution
                                        comes in.
                                    </p>

                                        Why Ramadan Iftar Contributions Matter During Ramadan, students are encouraged
                                        to give back to the community, especially
                                        to those who may not have access to sufficient food. The contributions made by
                                        fellow students, alumni, and the greater
                                        UG community help ensure that no student has to break their fast alone or
                                        without a proper meal. These contributions
                                        create an atmosphere of brotherhood and unity, fostering a supportive and
                                        compassionate environment.

                                        Student Initiatives for Iftar Contributions Several student organizations at UG,
                                        such as the Muslim Students’
                                        Association (MSA), have taken the initiative to organize iftar meals for the
                                        university community. These groups actively
                                        seek contributions from students, alumni, and faculty members to ensure that
                                        everyone, regardless of their financial
                                        status, can partake in the blessings of iftar during Ramadan.

                                        Why You Should Contribute Contributing to Ramadan iftar meals is not just about
                                        helping others; it’s a way to earn
                                        blessings and reward from Allah. It is also an opportunity to practice empathy,
                                        solidarity, and gratitude. When you
                                        donate or volunteer, you are making a tangible difference in the lives of fellow
                                        students, fostering a sense of unity
                                        and selflessness within the UG community.

                                        Conclusion Ramadan is a time for spiritual growth and generosity. As students of
                                        the University of Ghana, we have the
                                        opportunity to make a difference in the lives of those around us. By
                                        contributing to iftar meals, whether through
                                        monetary donations, food items, or volunteer efforts, we can come together as
                                        one community to support and uplift each
                                        other during this holy month. Let’s continue the tradition of charity and
                                        brotherhood, ensuring that no student is left
